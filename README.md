# 🌊 FloodAI 2024

*Urban Flood Risk Prediction and Response Planning using AI/ML*

### 🚨 The Urban Flooding Crisis

- **Rapid Urbanization and Climate Change**: Urban flooding is increasing in frequency and severity in Indian cities, leading to significant socio-economic challenges.

#### Current Gaps:

- ❌ Lack of real-time predictive systems.
- ❌ Inadequate infrastructure resilience.
- ❌ Insufficient data-driven emergency response mechanisms.

#### Credible Data:

- 🌐 **Surat (2006) Flood**
- 🌐 **Chennai (2021) Flood**

### ❓ Why This Problem is Worth Solving

- **Human Impact**: Urban floods result in loss of life, displacement, and long-term health issues.
- **Infrastructure Strain**: Overwhelmed drainage systems and inadequate urban planning exacerbate the problem.
- **Economic Impact**: Floods disrupt businesses, damage infrastructure, and lead to economic losses in billions.
- **Opportunity**: Leveraging AI and multi-source data to predict and manage urban flooding can prevent disasters.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

## 🎯 Benefits

### 📊 Dashboard Flood Prediction

#### Identify Flooded Areas on Map 🗺️

With the help of GIS data, FloodAI predicts areas where floods might happen and locates them.

#### Identify Nearest Shelter or Hospital Route 🏥

If a flood occurs, FloodAI identifies the nearest and safest resources like shelters or hospitals with optimal paths.

#### Identify Safe Places (During Flood) 🏞️

Location points represent flooding areas. FloodAI identifies safe zones based on elevation data.

- **Red**: Danger Zone 🚫
- **Yellow**: Normal Zone ⚠️
- **Green**: Safe Zone ✅

#### Suggest Insurance Plan 💡

- **High Premium** 🔴
- **Normal Premium** 🟡
- **Low Premium** 🟢

FloodAI predicts the occurrence of floods after 5-10 years, forms clusters based on probability, and suggests appropriate insurance plans.

## 🚀 FloodAI Scalability

### Current Solution

Our current solution is dedicated to **Surat City, Gujarat**, where it effectively identifies and predicts urban flood risks tailored to the city's unique topography and infrastructure.

### Scaling Across Indian Cities

- The system is designed to be flexible and customizable to suit different urban environments across India.
- Each component of FloodAI can be tailored to local conditions, such as unique topographies, drainage systems, and socio-economic factors.
- The solution’s scalability allows it to contribute to a national strategy for urban flood risk management.
